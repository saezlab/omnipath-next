descriptions:
- Ongoing analysis of macrophage-related datasets and an interest in consolidating
  our knowledge of a number of signalling pathways directed our choice of pathways
  to be mapped (see Figure 1). Public and propriety databases were initially used
  as resources for data mining, but ultimately all molecular interaction data was
  sourced from published literature. Manual curation of the literature was performed
  to firstly evaluate the quality of the evidence supporting an interaction and secondly,
  to extract the necessary and additional pieces of information required to 'understand'
  the pathway and construct an interaction diagram. We have drawn pathways based on
  our desire to model pathways active in a human macrophage and therefore all components
  have been depicted using standard human gene nomenclature (HGNC). However, our understanding
  of the pathway components and the interactions between them, have been drawn largely
  from a consensus view of literature knowledge. As such the pathways presented here
  are based on data derived from a range of different cellular systems and mammalian
  species (human and mouse).
