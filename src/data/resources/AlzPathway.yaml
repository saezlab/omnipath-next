descriptions:
- 'We collected 123 review articles related to AD accessible from PubMed. We then
  manually curated these review articles, and have built an AD pathway map by using
  CellDesigner. Molecules are distinguished by the following types: proteins, complexes,
  simple molecules, genes, RNAs, ions, degraded products, and phenotypes. Gene symbols
  are pursuant to the HGNC symbols. Reactions are also distinguished by the following
  categories: state transition, transcription, translation, heterodimer association,
  dissociation, transport, unknown transition, and omitted transition. All the reactions
  have evidences to the references in PubMed ID using the MIRIAM scheme. All the references
  used for constructing the AlzPathway are listed in the ‘References for AlzPathway’.
  Cellular types are distinguished by the followings: neuron, astrocyte, and microglial
  cells. Cellular compartments are also distinguished by the followings: brain blood
  barrier, presynaptic, postsynaptic, and their inner cellular localizations.'
