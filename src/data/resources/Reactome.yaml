  and metabolism
descriptions:
- Once the content of the module is approved by the author and curation staff, it
  is peer-reviewed on the development web-site, by one or more bench biologists selected
  by the curator in consultation with the author. The peer review is open and the
  reviewers are acknowledged in the database by name. Any issues raised in the review
  are resolved, and the new module is scheduled for release.
