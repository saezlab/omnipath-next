descriptions:
- The information within the IntAct database primarily consists of proteinâ€“protein
  interaction (PPI) data. The majority of the PPI data within the database is annotated
  to IMEx standards, as agreed by the IMEx consortium. All such records contain a
  full description of the experimental conditions in which the interaction was observed.
  This includes full details of the constructs used in each experiment, such as the
  presence and position of tags, the minimal binding region defined by deletion mutants
  and the effect of any point mutations, referenced to UniProtKB, the underlying protein
  sequence database. Protein interactions can be described down to the isoform level,
  or indeed to the post-translationally cleaved mature peptide level if such information
  is available in the publication, using the appropriate UniProtKB identifiers. Each
  entry in IntAct is peer reviewed by a senior curator, and not released until accepted
  by that curator. Additional rule-based checks are run at the database level, and
  manually fixed when necessary. Finally, on release of the data, the original author
  of each publication is contacted and asked to comment on the representation of their
  data; again manual updates are made to the entry should the author highlight any
  errors. All binary interactions evidences in the IntAct database, including those
  generated by Spoke expansion of co-complex data, are clustered to produce a non-redundant
  set of protein pairs (R. C. Jimenez et al., manuscript in preparation). Each binary
  pair is then scored, using a simple addition of the cumulated value of a weighted
  score for the interaction detection method and the interaction type for each interaction
  evidence associated with that binary pair, as described using the PSI-MI CV terms.
  The scores are given in Table 1, all children of each given parent receives that
  score. Only experimental data is scored, inferred interactions, for example, would
  be excluded. Any low confidence data or data manually tagged by a curator for exclusion
  from the process, would not be scored. Isoforms and post-processed protein chains
  are regarded as distinct proteins for scoring purposes.
