descriptions:
- The CORUM database is a collection of experimentally verified mammalian protein
  complexes. Information is manually derived by critical reading of the scientific
  literature from expert annotators. Information about protein complexes includes
  protein complex names, subunits, literature references as well as the function of
  the complexes. In order to provide a high-quality dataset of mammalian protein complexes,
  all entries are manually created. Only protein complexes which have been isolated
  and characterized by reliable experimental evidence are included in CORUM. To be
  considered for CORUM, a protein complex has to be isolated as one molecule and must
  not be a construct derived from several experiments. Also, artificial constructs
  of subcomplexes are not taken into account. Since information from high-throughput
  experi ments contains a significant fraction of false-positive results, this type
  of data is excluded. References for relevant articles were mainly found in general
  review articles, cross-references to related protein complexes within analysed literature
  and comments on referenced articles in UniProt.
