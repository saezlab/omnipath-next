descriptions:
- 'SPIKE’s data on relationships between entities come from three sources: (i) Highly
  curated data submitted directly to SPIKE database by SPIKE curators and experts
  in various biomedical domains. (ii) Data imported from external signaling pathway
  databaes. At present, SPIKE database imports such data from Reactome, KEGG, NetPath
  and The Transcription Factor Encyclopedia (http://www.cisreg.ca/cgi-bin/tfe/home.pl).
  (iii) Data on protein–protein interactions (PPIs) imported either directly from
  wide-scale studies that recorded such interactions [to date,PPI data were imported
  from Stelzl et al., Rual et al. and Lim et al.] or from external PPI databases [IntAct
  and MINT]. Relationship data coming from these different sources vary greatly in
  their quality and this is reflected by a quality level attribute, which is attached
  to each relationship in SPIKE database (Supplementary Data). Each relationship in
  SPIKE is linked to at least one PubMed reference that supports it. As of August
  2010, the SPIKE database contains 20 412 genes/proteins, 542 complexes (327 of high
  quality), 320 protein families (167 of high quality) and 39 small molecules. These
  entities are linked by 34 338 interactions (of which 2400 are of high quality) and
  6074 regulations (4420 of high quality). These are associated with 5873 journal
  references in total. Each of the maps is constructed by a domain expert; typically
  the same expert will also be responsible later for keeping it up-to-date. The expert
  reads the relevant literature and identifies those interactions and regulations
  that are pertinent to the pathway. The regulations and interactions in the database
  are assigned quality values ranging from 1 to 4. In general, relationships (regulations
  and interactions) derived from highly focused biochemical studies are assigned high
  quality (2 or 1) while those derived from high-throughput experiments are assigned
  lower quality (4 or 3). The curator uses best judgment to assign a quality level.
  For example, relationships mentioned in two independent research reports, or cited
  repeatedly in reviews written by leading authorities will get quality 1. Relationships
  with cited concrete references and those imported en masse from external curated
  signaling DBs are initially assigned quality 2 but later can be changed to the highest
  quality after the curator has read and was convinced by the cited papers. Data imported
  from protein-protein interaction DBs and datasets are assigned quality 3 or 4, depending
  on the experimental technique.'
