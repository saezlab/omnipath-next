recommend: integrates many small efforts; beside phosphorylations provides all types

descriptions:
- Due to the inaccessibility of database contents in several online PTM resources,
  a total 11 biological databases related to PTMs are integrated in dbPTM, including
  UniProtKB/SwissProt, version 9.0 of Phospho.ELM, PhosphoSitePlus, PHOSIDA, version
  6.0 of O-GLYCBASE, dbOGAP, dbSNO, version 1.0 of UbiProt, PupDB, version 1.1 of
  SysPTM and release 9.0 of HPRD. With the high throughput of MS-based methods in
  post-translational proteomics, this update also includes manually curated MS/MS-identified
  peptides associated with PTMs from research articles through a literature survey.
  First, a table list of PTM-related keywords is constructed by referring to the UniProtKB/SwissProt
  PTM list (http://www.uniprot.org/docs/ptmlist.txt) and the annotations of RESID
  (28). Then, all fields in the PubMed database are searched based on the keywords
  of the constructed table list. This is then followed by downloading the full text
  of the research articles. For the various experiments of proteomic identification,
  a text-mining system is developed to survey full-text literature that potentially
  describes the site-specific identification of modified sites. Approximately 800
  original and review articles associated with MS/MS proteomics and protein modifications
  are retrieved from PubMed (July 2012). Next, the full-length articles are manually
  reviewed for precisely extracting the MS/MS peptides along with the modified sites.
  Furthermore, in order to determine the locations of PTMs on a full-length protein
  sequence, the experimentally verified MS/MS peptides are then mapped to UniProtKB
  protein entries based on its database identifier (ID) and sequence identity. In
  the process of data mapping, MS/MS peptides that cannot align exactly to a protein
  sequence are discarded. Finally, each mapped PTM site is attributed with a corresponding
  literature (PubMed ID).
- dbPTM was developed as a comprehensive database of experimentally verified PTMs
  from several databases with annotations of potential PTMs for all UniProtKB protein
  entries. For this tenth anniversary of dbPTM, the updated resource includes not
  only a comprehensive dataset of experimentally verified PTMs, supported by the literature,
  but also an integrative interface for accessing all available databases and tools
  that are associated with PTM analysis. As well as collecting experimental PTM data
  from 14 public databases, this update manually curates over 12,000 modified peptides,
  including the emerging S-nitrosylation, S-glutathionylation and succinylation, from
  approximately 500 research articles, which were retrieved by text mining.
