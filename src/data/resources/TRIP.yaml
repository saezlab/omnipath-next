descriptions:
- The literature on TRP channel PPIs found in the PubMed database serve as the primary
  information source for constructing the TRIP Database. First, a list of synonyms
  for the term ‘TRP channels’ was constructed from UniprotKB, Entrez Gene, membrane
  protein databases (Supplementary Table S2) and published review papers for nomenclature.
  Second, using these synonyms, a list of articles was obtained through a PubMed search.
  Third, salient articles were collected through a survey of PubMed abstracts and
  subsequently by search of full-text papers. Finally, we selected articles that contain
  evidence for physical binding among the proteins denoted. To prevent omission of
  relevant papers, we manually screened information in other databases, such as DIP,
  IntAct, MINT, STRING, BioGRID, Entrez Gene, IUPHAR-DB and ISI Web of Knowledge (from
  Thomson Reuters). All 277 articles used for database construction are listed in
  our database website.
