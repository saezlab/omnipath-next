recommend: the only resource focusing on dephosphorylation interactions; most of these
  can not be found anywhere else
descriptions:
- DEPOD the human DEPhOsphorylation Database (version 1.0) is a manually curated database
  collecting human active phosphatases, their experimentally verified protein and
  non-protein substrates and dephosphorylation site information, and pathways in which
  they are involved. It also provides links to popular kinase databases and protein-protein
  interaction databases for these phosphatases and substrates. DEPOD aims to be a
  valuable resource for studying human phosphatases and their substrate specificities
  and molecular mechanisms; phosphatase-targeted drug discovery and development; connecting
  phosphatases with kinases through their common substrates; completing the human
  phosphorylation/dephosphorylation network.
