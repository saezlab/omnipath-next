- To construct the human cellular signalling network, we manually curated signalling
  pathways from literature. The signalling data source for our pathways is the BioCarta
  database (http://www.biocarta.com/genes/allpathways.asp), which, so far, is the
  most comprehensive database for human cellular signalling pathways. Our curated
  pathway database recorded gene names and functions, cellular locations of each gene
  and relationships between genes such as activation, inhibition, translocation, enzyme
  digestion, gene transcription and translation, signal stimulation and so on. To
  ensure the accuracy and the consistency of the database, each referenced pathway
  was cross-checked by different researchers and finally all the documented pathways
  were checked by one researcher. In total, 164 signalling pathways were documented
  (supplementary Table 2). Furthermore, we merged the curated data with another literature-mined
  human cellular signalling network. As a result, the merged network contains nearly
  1100 proteins (SupplementaryNetworkFile). To construct a signalling network, we
  considered relationships of proteins as links (activation or inactivation as directed
  links and physical interactions in protein complexes as neutral links) and proteins
  as nodes.
