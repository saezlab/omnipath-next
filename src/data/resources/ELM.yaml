recommend: 'structural details: domain-motif relationships; very high confidence'
descriptions:
- Ideally, each motif class has multiple example instances of this motif annotated,
  whereby an instance is described as a match to the regular expression pattern of
  the ELM motif class in a protein sequence. For each instance entry, ideally, multiple
  sources of experimental evidence are recorded (identifying participant, detecting
  motif presence and detecting interaction), and, following annotation best practices,
  a reliability score is given by the annotator.
