recommend: one of the earliest interaction databases; remarkable literature curation
  effort
descriptions:
- 'In the beginning (near 2000), it was a entirely manually curated database: Currently
  proteinâ€“protein interactions are entered into the DIP only following publication
  in peer-reviewed journals. Entry is done manually by the curator, followed by automated
  tests that show the proteins and citations exist. Interactions are double-checked
  by a second curator and flagged accordingly in the database. From 2001, it contains
  high-throughput interactions: Because the reliability of experimental evidence varies
  widely, methods of quality assessment have been developed and utilized to identify
  the most reliable subset of the interactions. This CORE set can be used as a reference
  when evaluating the reliability of high-throughput protein-protein interaction data
  sets, for development of prediction methods, as well as in the studies of the properties
  of protein interaction networks.'
