descriptions:
- 'In curating, editors synthesize meaningful networks of events into defined pathways
  and adhere to the PID data model for consistency in data representation: molecules
  and biological processes are annotated with standardized names and unambiguous identifiers;
  and signaling and regulatory events are annotated with evidence codes and references.
  To ensure accurate data representation, editors assemble pathways from data that
  is principally derived from primary research publications. The majority of data
  in PID is human; however, if a finding discovered in another mammal is also deemed
  to occur in humans, editors may decide to include this finding, but will also record
  that the evidence was inferred from another species. Prior to publication, all pathways
  are reviewed by one or more experts in a field for accuracy and completeness.'
