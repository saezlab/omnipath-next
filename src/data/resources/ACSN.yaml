recommend: the third largest process description resource; focused on signaling pathways;
  relationships mapped into a topological space
descriptions:
- The map curator studies the body of literature dedicated to the biological process
  or molecular mechanism of interest. The initial sources of information are the major
  review articles from high-impact journals that represent the consensus view on the
  studied topic and also provide a list of original references. The map curator extracts
  information from review papers and represents it in the form of biochemical reactions
  in CellDesigner. This level of details reflects the ‘canonical’ mechanisms. Afterwards,
  the curator extends the search and analyses original papers from the list provided
  in the review articles and beyond. This information is used to enrich the map with
  details from the recent discoveries in the field. The rule for confident acceptance
  and inclusion of a biochemical reaction or a process is the presence of sufficient
  evidences from more than two studies, preferably from different scientific groups.
  The content of ACSN is also verified and compared with publicly available databases
  such as REACTOME, KEGG, WikiPathways, BioCarta, Cell Signalling and others to ensure
  comprehensive representation of consensus pathways and links on PMIDs of original
  articles confirmed annotated molecular interactions.
- CellDesigner 3.5 version was used to enter biological facts from a carefully studied
  selection of papers (see the whole bibliography on the web site with Supplementary
  information). Whenever the details of a biological fact could not be naturally expressed
  with CellDesigner standard notations, it was fixed and some solution was proposed.
  For example, we added a notation (co‐factor) to describe all the components intervening
  in the transcription of genes mediated by the E2F family proteins.
