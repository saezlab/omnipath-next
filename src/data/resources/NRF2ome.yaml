descriptions:
- 'From Korcsmaros 2010: ... we first listed signaling proteins and interactions from
  reviews and then added further signaling interactions of the listed proteins. We
  used reviews as a starting point, manually looked up interactions three times, and
  manually searched for interactions of known signaling proteins with no signaling
  interactions so far in the database.'
