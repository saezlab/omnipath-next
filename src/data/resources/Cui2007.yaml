- To build up the human signaling network, we manually curated the signaling molecules
  (most of them are proteins) and the interactions between these molecules from the
  most comprehensive signaling pathway database, BioCarta (http://www.biocarta.com/).
  The pathways in the database are illustrated as diagrams. We manually recorded the
  names, functions, cellular locations, biochemical classifications and the regulatory
  (including activating and inhibitory) and interaction relations of the signaling
  molecules for each signaling pathway. To ensure the accuracy of the curation, all
  the data have been crosschecked four times by different researchers. After combining
  the curated information with another literature‐mined signaling network that contains
  ∼500 signaling molecules (Ma'ayan et al, 2005)[this is the CA1], we obtained a signaling
  network containing ∼1100 proteins (Awan et al, 2007). We further extended this network
  by extracting and adding the signaling molecules and their relations from the Cancer
  Cell Map (http://cancer.cellmap.org/cellmap/), a database that contains 10 manually
  curated signaling pathways for cancer. As a result, the network contains 1634 nodes
  and 5089 links that include 2403 activation links (positive links), 741 inhibitory
  links (negative links), 1915 physical links (neutral links) and 30 links whose types
  are unknown (Supplementary Table 9). To our knowledge, this network is the biggest
  cellular signaling network at present.
- 'From Awan 2007: To construct the human cellular signalling network, we manually
  curated signalling pathways from literature. The signalling data source for our
  pathways is the BioCarta database (http://www.biocarta.com/genes/allpathways.asp),
  which, so far, is the most comprehensive database for human cellular signalling
  pathways. Our curated pathway database recorded gene names and functions, cellular
  locations of each gene and relationships between genes such as activation, inhibition,
  translocation, enzyme digestion, gene transcription and translation, signal stimulation
  and so on. To ensure the accuracy and the consistency of the database, each referenced
  pathway was cross-checked by different researchers and finally all the documented
  pathways were checked by one researcher.'
