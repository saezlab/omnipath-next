descriptions:
- SIGNOR, the SIGnaling Network Open Resource, organizes and stores in a structured
  format signaling information published in the scientific literature. The captured
  information is stored as binary causative relationships between biological entities
  and can be represented graphically as activity flow. The entire network can be freely
  downloaded and used to support logic modeling or to interpret high content datasets.
  The core of this project is a collection of more than 11000 manually-annotated causal
  relationships between proteins that participate in signal transduction. Each relationship
  is linked to the literature reporting the experimental evidence. In addition each
  node is annotated with the chemical inhibitors that modulate its activity. The signaling
  information is mapped to the human proteome even if the experimental evidence is
  based on experiments on mammalian model organisms.
