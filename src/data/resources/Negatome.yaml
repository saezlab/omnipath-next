descriptions:
- Annotation of the manual dataset was performed analogous to the annotation of proteinâ€“protein
  interactions and protein complexes in previous projects published by our group.
  Information about NIPs was extracted from scientific literature using only data
  from individual experiments but not from high-throughput experiments. Only mammalian
  proteins were considered. Data from high-throughput experiments were omitted in
  order to maintain the highest possible standard of reliability.
