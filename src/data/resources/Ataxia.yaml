- In order to expand the interaction dataset, we added relevant direct protein–protein
  interactions from currently available human protein–protein interaction networks
  (Rual et al., 2005; Stelzl et al., 2005). We also searched public databases, including
  BIND (Bader et al., 2003), DIP (Xenarios et al., 2002), HPRD (Peri et al., 2003),
  MINT (Zanzoni et al., 2002), and MIPS (Pagel et al., 2005), to identify literature-based
  binary interactions involving the 54 ataxia-associated baits and the 561 interacting
  prey proteins. We identified 4796 binary protein–protein interactions for our Y2H
  baits and prey proteins (Table S4) and incorporated them in the Y2H protein–protein
  interaction map (Figures 4A–4C).
