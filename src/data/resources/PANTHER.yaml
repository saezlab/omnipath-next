descriptions:
- References are captured at three levels. First, each pathway as a whole requires
  a reference. For signaling pathways, at least three references, usually review papers,
  are required in order to provide a more objective view of the scope of the pathway.
  For metabolic pathways, a textbook reference is usually sufficient. Second, references
  are often associated to each molecule class in the pathway. Most of these references
  are OMIM records or review papers. Third, references are provided to support association
  of specific protein sequences with a particular molecule class, e.g., the SWISS-PROT
  sequence P53_HUMAN annotated as an instance of the molecule class ‘‘P53’’ appearing
  in the pathway class ‘‘P53 pathway’’. These are usually research papers that report
  the experimental evidence that a particular protein or gene participates in the
  reactions represented in the pathway diagram. There are three major properties that
  make this infrastructure differ from other pathway curation systems, such as from
  Reactome and EcoCyc. First, the pathway diagrams are drawn with CellDesigner software.
  There are two advantages to using CellDesigner. First, controlled graphical notations
  are used to draw the pathway diagram, and the software automatically creates a computational
  representation that is compatible with the SBML standard. Second, a pathway diagram
  can be viewed with an exact, one-to-one correspondence with the ontological representation
  of the pathways stored in the back-end. The second property is that the scope of
  the pathway is defined first based on literature, and pathway components (proteins,
  genes, RNAs) are treated as ontology terms, or molecule classes, rather than specific
  instances. This means that multiple proteins from the same organism or different
  organisms can potentially play the same given role in a pathway. The advantage is
  that the work flow is more similar to the thinking process of the biologists who
  are the users of our curation software module. The third major property is that
  the curation software is designed to be simple enough to be used directly by bench
  biologists after a brief training course. All other pathway databases we are aware
  of employ highly trained curators, who of course cannot be experts in all areas
  of biology. The current set of PANTHER pathways has been curated by more than 40
  different external experts from the scientific community; they must only have demonstrated
  their expertise with publications in the relevant field.
