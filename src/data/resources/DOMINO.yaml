descriptions:
- 'DOMINO aims at annotating all the available information about domain-peptide and
  domain–domain interactions. The core of DOMINO, of July 24, 2006 consists of more
  than 3900 interactions extracted from peer-reviewed articles and annotated by expert
  biologists. A total of 717 manuscripts have been processed, thus covering a large
  fraction of the published information about domain–peptide interactions. The curation
  effort has focused on the following domains: SH3, SH2, 14-3-3, PDZ, PTB, WW, EVH,
  VHS, FHA, EH, FF, BRCT, Bromo, Chromo and GYF. However, interactions mediated by
  as many as 150 different domain families are stored in DOMINO.'
- DOMINO is an open-access database comprising more than 3900 annotated experiments
  describing interactions mediated by protein-interaction domains. The curation effort
  aims at covering the interactions mediated by the following domains (SH3, SH2, 14-3-3,
  PDZ, PTB, WW, EVH, VHS, FHA, EH, FF, BRCT, Bromo, Chromo, GYF). However, interactions
  mediated by as many as 150 different domain families are stored in DOMINO.
- The curation process follows the PSI-MI 2.5 standard but with special emphasis on
  the mapping of the interaction to specific protein domains of both participating
  proteins. This is achieved by paying special attention to the shortest protein fragment
  that was experimentally verified as sufficient for the interaction. Whenever the
  authors report only the name of the domain mediating the interaction (i.e. SH3,
  SH2 ...), without stating the coordinates of the experimental binding range, the
  curator may choose to enter the coordinates of the Pfam domain match in the protein
  sequence. Finally whenever the information is available, any mutation or posttranslational
  modification affecting the interaction affinity is noted in the database.
