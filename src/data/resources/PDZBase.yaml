recommend: a handful specific interactions for proteins with PDZ domain
descriptions:
- 'PDZBase is a database that aims to contain all known PDZ-domain-mediated protein-protein
  interactions. Currently, PDZBase contains approximately 300 such interactions, which
  have been manually extracted from &gt;200 articles. PDZBase currently contains âˆ¼300
  interactions, all of which have been manually extracted from the literature, and
  have been independently verified by two curators. The extracted information comes
  from in vivo (co-immunoprecipitation) or in vitro experiments (GST-fusion or related
  pull-down experiments). Interactions identified solely from high throughput methods
  (e.g. yeast two-hybrid or mass spectrometry) were not included in PDZBase. Other
  prerequisites for inclusion in the database are: that knowledge of the binding sites
  on both interacting proteins must be available (for instance through a truncation
  or mutagenesis experiment); that interactions must be mediated directly by the PDZ-domain,
  and not by any other possible domain within the protein.'
