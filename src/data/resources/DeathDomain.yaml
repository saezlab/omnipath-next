recommend: focused deep curation effort on death domain superfamily proteins; many
  specific relationships
descriptions:
- The PubMed database was used as the primary source for collecting information and
  constructing the DD database. After finding synonyms for each of the 99 DD superfamily
  proteins using UniProtKB and Entrez Gene, we obtained a list of articles using each
  name of the proteins and its synonyms on a PubMed search, and we selected the articles
  that contained evidence for physical binding among the proteins denoted. We also
  manually screened information that was in other databases, such as DIP, IntAct,
  MINT, STRING and Entrez Gene. All of the 295 articles used for database construction
  are listed on our database website.
