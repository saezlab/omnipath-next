descriptions:
- The information about protein-protein interactions was cataloged after a critical
  reading of the published literature. Exhaustive searches were done based on keywords
  and medical subject headings (MeSH) by using Entrez. The type of experiments that
  served as the basis for establishing protein-protein interactions was also annotated.
  Experiments such as coimmunoprecipitation were designated in vivo, GST fusion and
  similar “pull-down” type of experiments were designated in vitro, and those identified
  by yeast two-hybrid were annotated as yeast two-hybrid. Posttranslational modifications
  were annotated based on the type of modification, site of modification, and the
  modified residue. In addition, the upstream enzymes that are responsible for modifications
  of these proteins were reported if described in the articles. The most commonly
  known and the alternative subcellular localization of the protein were based on
  the literature. The sites of expression of protein and/or mRNA were annotated based
  on published studies.
