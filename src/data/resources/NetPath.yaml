recommend: the smallest process description resource, but represents a high quality
  literature curation effort; provides pathway annotations
descriptions:
- The initial annotation process of any signaling pathway involves gathering and reading
  of review articles to achieve a brief overview of the pathway. This process is followed
  by listing all the molecules that arereported to be involved in the pathway under
  annotation. Information regarding potential pathway authorities are also gathered
  at this initial stage. Pathway experts are involved in initial screening of the
  molecules listed to check for any obvious omissions. In the second phase, annotators
  manually perform extensive literature searches using search keys, which include
  all the alter native names of the molecules involved, the name of the pathway, the
  names of reactions, and so on. In addition, the iHOP resource is also used to perform
  advanced PubMed-based literature searches to collect the reactions that were reported
  to be implicated in a given pathway. The collected reactions are manually entered
  using the PathBuilder annotation interface, which is subjected to an internal review
  process involving PhD level scientists with expertise in the areas of molecular
  biology, immunology and biochemistry. However, there are instances where a molecule
  has been implicated in a pathway in a published report but the associated experimental
  evidence is either weak or differs from experiments carried out by other groups.
  For this purpose, we recruit several investigators as pathway authorities based
  on their expertise in individual signaling pathways. The review by pathway authorities
  occasionally leads to correction of errors or, more commonly, to inclusion of additional
  information. Finally, the pathway authorities help in assessing whether the work
  of all major laboratories has been incorporated for the given signaling pathway.
