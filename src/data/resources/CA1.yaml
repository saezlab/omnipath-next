descriptions:
- 'We used published research literature to identify the key components of signaling
  pathways and cellular machines, and their binary interactions. Most components (~80%)
  have been described in hippocampal neurons or related neuronal cells. Other components
  are from other cells, but are included because they are key components in processes
  known to occur in hippocampal neurons, such as translation. We then established
  that these interactions were both direct and functionally relevant. All of the connections
  were individually verified by at least one of the authors of this paper by reading
  the relevant primary paper(s). We developed a system made of 545 components (nodes)
  and 1259 links (connections). We used arbitrary but consistent rules to sort components
  into various groups. For instance, transcription factors are considered a as part
  of the transcriptional machinery, although it may also be equally valid to consider
  them as the most downstream component of the central signaling network. Similarly
  the AMPA receptor-channel (AMPAR) is considered part of the ion channels in the
  electrical response system since its activity is essential to defining the postsynaptic
  response, although it binds to and is activated by glutamate, and hence can be also
  considered a ligand gated receptor-channel in the plasma membrane. The links were
  specified by two criteria: function and biochemical mechanism. Three types of functional
  links were specified. This follows the rules used for representation of pathways
  in Scienceâ€™s STKE (S1). Links may be activating, inhibitory or neutral. Neutral
  links do not specify directionality between components, and are mostly used to represent
  scaffolding and anchoring undirected or bidirectional interactions. The biochemical
  specification includes defining the reactions as non-covalent binding interactions
  or enzymatic reactions. Within the enzymatic category, reactions were further specified
  as phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, hydrolysis, etc. These two criteria for specification
  are independent and were defined for all interactions. For the analyses in this
  study we only used the functional criteria: activating, inhibitory or neutral specifications.
  We chose papers that demonstrated direct interactions that were supported by either
  biochemical or physiological effects of the interactions. From these papers we identified
  the components and interactions that make up the system we analyzed. During this
  specification process we did not consider whether these interactions would come
  together to form higher order organizational units. Each component and interaction
  was validated by a reference from the primary literature (1202 papers were used).
  A list of authors who read the papers to validate the components and interactions
  is provided under authors contributions.'
