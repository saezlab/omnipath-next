recommend: one of the largest resources with effect sign; due to its specific, biochemically
  defined pathways suitable for cross-talk analysis
descriptions:
- In each of the three organisms, we first listed signaling proteins and interactions
  from reviews (and from WormBook in C.elegans) and then added further signaling interactions
  of the listed proteins. To identify additional interactions in C.elegans, we examined
  all interactions (except for transcription regulation) of the signaling proteins
  listed in WormBase and added only those to SignaLink that we could manually identify
  in the literature as an experimentally verified signaling interaction. For D.melanogaster,
  we added to SignaLink those genetic interactions from FlyBase that were also reported
  in at least one yeast-2-hybrid experiment. For humans, we manually checked the reliability
  and directions for the PPIs found with the search engines iHop and Chilibot. SignaLink
  assigns proteins to signaling pathways using the full texts of pathway reviews (written
  by pathway experts). While most signaling resources consider 5â€“15 reviews per pathway,
  SignaLink uses a total of 170 review papers, i.e. more than 20 per pathway on average.
  Interactions were curated from a total of 941 articles (PubMed IDs are available
  at the website). We added a small number of proteins based on InParanoid ortholog
  clusters. For curation, we used a self-developed graphical tool and Perl/Python
  scripts. The current version of SignaLink was completed in May 2008 based on WormBase
  (version 191), FlyBase (2008.6), Ensembl, UniProt and the publications listed on
  the website. The curation protocol of SignaLink (Fig. 1A) contains several steps
  aimed specifically at reducing data and curation errors. We used reviews as a starting
  point, manually looked up interactions three times, and manually searched for interactions
  of known signaling proteins with no signaling interactions so far in the database.
