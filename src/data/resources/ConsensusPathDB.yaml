- Interaction data in ConsensusPathDB currently originates from 12 interaction databases
  and comprises physical interactions, biochemical reactions and gene regulations.
  Importantly, the source of physical entities and interactions is always recorded,
  which allows linking to the original data in the source database. In order to assess
  the content overlap of the source databases and to reduce redundancy, we have applied
  a method to merge identical physical entities and identify similar interactions.
  The method is straightforward and efficient for the integration of networks from
  any single species. Simple physical entities of the same type (genes, proteins,
  transcripts, metabolites) are compared on the basis of common database identifiers
  like UniProt, Ensembl, Entrez, ChEBI, etc. Since different databases tend to annotate
  physical entities with different identifier types (e.g. some databases annotate
  proteins with UniProt identifiers, others with Ensembl identifiers), we first translated
  the annotations to a uniform identifier type, which is a UniProt entry name in case
  of proteins, Ensembl gene ID in case of genes and transcripts, and KEGG/ChEBI ID
  in case of metabolites. Protein complexes are compared according to their individual
  protein composition. Simple physical entities with the same identifier, and complexes
  with the same composition, are merged in ConsensusPathDB. Information provided by
  the according source databases for the merged entities is stored in a complementary
  manner. Functional interactions of physical entities are also compared with each
  other. Here, we distinguish between primary and secondary interaction participants.
  Primary participants are substrates and products in case of biochemical reactions,
  interactors in case of physical interactions and target genes in case of gene regulation.
  All other participants, e.g. enzymes and interaction modifiers, are secondary participants.
  If the primary participants of two or more interactions match, these interactions
  are considered similar. Two similar interactions may have different stoichiometry,
  modification and/or localization of the participants. To allow for flexibility,
  similar interactions are marked as such in the database, but the decision whether
  they should be considered identical despite mismatching details is left to the user
  and depends on his specific problem. Moreover, ConsensusPathDB does not provide
  any additional quality control filters. All interactions provided by the different
  database sources are treated in the same way.
