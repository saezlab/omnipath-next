descriptions:
- The first and foremost principle of our MPPI database is to favor quality over completeness.
  Therefore, we decided to include only published experimental evidence derived from
  individual experiments as opposed to large-scale surveys. High-throughput data may
  be integrated later, but will be marked to distinguish it from evidence derived
  from individual experiments.
