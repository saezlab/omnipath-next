recommend: old literature curated resource; effect signs for some interactions
descriptions:
- Manually curated data, unpublished. A team of M.Sc. and Ph.D. biologists at the
  Institute of Bioinformatics in Bangalore, India read original research papers and
  hand-entered the pathway data into our database. The quality of the Cancer Cell
  Map pathways is very high. Half of the pathways were reviewed by experts at Memorial
  Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and were found to contain only a few errors, which
  were subsequently fixed. A pathway is a collection of all genes/proteins that have
  been described as pathway members in any publication and all the interactions between
  them that can be found described in the literature.
