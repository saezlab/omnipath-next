recommend: small, literature curated interaction resource; many interactions for receptors
  and extracellular proteins
descriptions:
- Protein data were imported from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (Bairoch et al.,
  2005) and identified by UniProtKB/SwissProt accession numbers. In order to list
  all the partners of a protein, interactions are associated by default to the accession
  number of the human protein. The actual source species used in experiments is indicated
  in the page reporting interaction data. Intracellular and membrane proteins were
  included to obtain a comprehensive network of the partners of extracellular molecules.
  Indeed, ECM proteins and GAGs bind to a number of membrane proteins or cell-associated
  proteoglycans and some of them interact with intracellular partners upon internalization
  (Dixelius et al., 2000). ECM proteins were identified by the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
  keyword ‘extracellular matrix’ and by the GO terms ‘extracellular matrix’, ‘proteinaceous
  extracellular matrix’ and their child terms. The proteins annotated with the GO
  terms ‘extracellular region’ and ‘extracellular space’, which are used for proteins
  found in biological fluids, were not included because circulating molecules do not
  directly contribute to the extracellular scaffold. Additionally, 96 proteins were
  manually (re-)annotated through literature curation. MatrixDB integrates 1378 interactions
  from the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD, Prasad et al., 2009), 211 interactions
  from the Molecular INTeraction database (MINT, Chatr-Aryamontri et al., 2007), 46
  interactions from the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP, Salwinski et al., 2004),
  232 interactions from IntAct (Kerrien et al., 2007a) and 839 from BioGRID (Breitkreutz
  et al., 2008) involving at least one extracellular biomolecule of mammalian origin.
  We added 283 interactions from manual literature curation and 65 interactions from
  protein and GAG array experiments.
- Interaction data stored in MatrixDB are (i) experimentally determined in the laboratory
  using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assays, including protein and glycosaminoglycan
  arrays probed by SPR imaging, (ii) extracted from the literature by manual curation
  and (iii) imported from other interaction databases belonging to the IMEx consortium
  [IntAct, DIP, MINT, BioGRID], as well as from the Human Protein Reference Database.
  Imported data are restricted to interactions involving at least one extracellular
  protein.
- The content of MatrixDB has been updated with new interaction data manually curated
  by the MatrixDB team, and by importing interaction data from four interaction databases
  of the IMEx consortium via The Proteomics Standard Initiative Common QUery InterfaCe
  (PSICQUIC), a community standard for computational access to molecular-interaction
  data resources. In the current release MatrixDB contains 904 interactions supported
  by 1244 experiments, which have been manually curated from 237 publications, compared
  to 490 interactions supported by 847 experiments in the previous version of the
  database. This is the MatrixDB ‘core’ data set.
