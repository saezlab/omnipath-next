recommend: one of the strongest in ligand-receptor interactions; still does not contain
  everything, therefore worth to combine with larger activity flow resources like
  Signor
descriptions:
- Presently, the resource describes the interactions between target proteins and 6064
  distinct ligand entities (Table 1). Ligands are listed against targets by their
  action (e.g. activator, inhibitor), and also classified according to substance types
  and their status as approved drugs. Classes include metabolites (a general category
  for all biogenic, non-peptide, organic molecules including lipids, hormones and
  neurotransmitters), synthetic organic chemicals (e.g. small molecule drugs), natural
  products, mammalian endogenous peptides, synthetic and other peptides including
  toxins from non-mammalian organisms, antibodies, inorganic substances and other,
  not readily classifiable compounds. The new database was constructed by integrating
  data from IUPHAR-DB and the published GRAC compendium. An overview of the curation
  process is depicted as an organizational flow chart in Figure 2. New information
  was added to the existing relational database behind IUPHAR-DB and new webpages
  were created to display the integrated information. For each new target, information
  on human, mouse and rat genes and proteins, including gene symbol, full name, location,
  gene ID, UniProt and Ensembl IDs was manually curated from HGNC, the Mouse Genome
  Database (MGD) at Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI), the Rat Genome Database (RGD),
  UniProt and Ensembl, respectively. In addition, ‘Other names’, target-specific fields
  such as ‘Principal transduction’, text from the ‘Overview’ and ‘Comments’ sections
  and reference citations (downloaded from PubMed; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed)
  were captured from GRAC and uploaded into the database against a unique Object ID.
