descriptions:
- We have integrated three existing databases, including Phospho.ELM (release 6.0,
  total 9236 phosphorylation sites), HPRD (release 6, total 8992 phosphorylation sites),
  SwissProt (release 51.5, total 6529 phosphorylation sites), and our manually curated
  400 kinaseâ€“substrate pairs, which are primarily from review articles. Among these
  phosphorylation sites, 7843 (6152+995+696) are from high-throughput (HTP) screening,
  6329 (3828+1152+1349) are from low-throughput (LTP) analysis, and only 679 (420+97+162)
  are both from HTP and LTP screening. One special note is that there are 887 phosphorylation
  sites, which do not have annotation from literature in the SwissProt database and
  it is not possible distinguish whether these are from HTP or LTP.
