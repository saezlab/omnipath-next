recommend: the largest kinase-substrate database; huge amount of literature referenced
descriptions:
- 'PSP integrates both low- and high-throughput (LTP and HTP) data sources into a
  single reliable and comprehensive resource. Nearly 10,000 journal articles , including
  both LTP and HTP reports, have been manually curated by expert scientists from over
  480 different journals since 2001. Information from nearly 13 000 papers and 600
  different journals characterizing modification sites with LTP methods has been curated
  into PSP. Information is gathered from published literature and other sources. Published
  literature is searched semi-automatically with multiple intelligent search algorithms
  to identify reports that potentially identify phosphorylation sites in human, mouse
  or other species. Each identified report is then scanned by our highly trained curatorial
  staff (all with PhDs and extensive research experience in cell biology or related
  disciplines) to select only those papers that either identify new physiological
  phosphorylation sites or those that illuminate the biological function of the phosphorylation
  event. Records that are selected for inclusion into PhosphoSite are placed in the
  curatorial queue for processing. Note: while we gather records that describe both
  in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation events, we only finally submit records about
  in vitro sites when we have additional hard evidence that the site is also phosphorylated
  in vivo.'
