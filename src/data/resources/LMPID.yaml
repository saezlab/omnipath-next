descriptions:
- LMPID (Linear Motif mediated Protein Interaction Database) is a manually curated
  database which provides comprehensive experimentally validated information about
  the LMs mediating PPIs from all organisms on a single platform. About 2200 entries
  have been compiled by detailed manual curation of PubMed abstracts, of which about
  1000 LM entries were being annotated for the first time, as compared with the Eukaryotic
  LM resource.
