descriptions:
- InnateDB (www.innatedb.com) is a database and integrated analysis platform specifically
  designed to facilitate systems-level analyses of the mammalian innate immune response
  (Lynn et al. 2008; 2010, 2013). To enrich our knowledge of innate immunity networks
  and pathways, the InnateDB curation team has contextually annotated >25,000 human
  and mouse innate immunity-relevant molecular interactions through the review of
  >5,000 biomedical articles. Curation adheres to the MIMIx guidelines and new interactions
  are added weekly. Importantly, interactions are curated between molecules with a
  documented role in an innate immunity relevant biological process or pathway and
  all other interactors regardless of whether the interacting molecule has any known
  role in innate immunity. This approach captures interactions between the innate
  immune system and other systems. InnateDB is not limited to data on the innate immune
  system. It is a comprehensive database of human, mouse and bovine molecular interactions
  and pathways, consisting of more than 300,000 molecular interactions and 3,000+
  pathways, integrated from major public molecular interaction and pathway databases.
  InnateDB is also an analysis platform offering user-friendly bioinformatics tools,
  including pathway and ontology analysis, network visualization and analysis and
  the ability to upload and analyze user-supplied gene expression or other quantitative
  data in a network and/or pathway context. The platform has a global profile and
  is utilised by >10,000 users per annum and is widely cited. A mirror of the site
  hosted in Australia is also available at innatedb.sahmri.com. Note that new interactions
  and gene annotations are added to InnateDB on an almost weekly database so the data
  is being continuously updated.
