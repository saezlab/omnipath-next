- In order to offer a proteome-wide perspective of the phosphatase interactome, we
  have embarked on an extensive text-mining-assisted literature curation effort to
  extend phosphatase interaction information that was not yet covered by proteinâ€“protein
  interaction (PPI) databases. Interaction evidence captured by expert curators was
  annotated in the protein interaction database MINT according to the rapid curation
  standard. This data set was next integrated with protein interaction information
  from three additional major PPI databases, IntAct, BioGRID and DIP. These databases
  are part of the PSIMEx consortium and adopt a common data model and common controlled
  vocabularies, thus facilitating data integration. Duplicated entries were merged
  and redundant interactions have been removed. As a result, from the HuPho website
  it is possible to explore experimental evidence from 718 scientific articles reporting
  4600 experiments supporting protein interactions where at least one of the partners
  is a phosphatase. Since some interactions are supported by more than one piece of
  evidence, the actual number of non-redundant interactions is smaller, 2500 at the
  time of writing this paper. Moreover, 199 phosphatases have at least one reported
  ligand, while 53 have none. Interaction evidence is fairly evenly distributed in
  the four PSIMEx resources suggesting a substantial lack of overlap among the data
  curated by each database.
