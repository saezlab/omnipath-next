recommend: one of the largest kinase-substrate databases; substantial number of specific
  proteins and interactions, with more receptors than PhosphoSite
descriptions:
- Phospho.ELM http://phospho.elm.eu.org is a new resource containing experimentally
  verified phosphorylation sites manually curated from the literature and is developed
  as part of the ELM (Eukaryotic Linear Motif) resource. Phospho.ELM constitutes the
  largest searchable collection of phosphorylation sites available to the research
  community. The Phospho.ELM entries store information about substrate proteins with
  the exact positions of residues known to be phosphorylated by cellular kinases.
  Additional annotation includes literature references, subcellular compartment, tissue
  distribution, and information about the signaling pathways involved as well as links
  to the molecular interaction database MINT. Phospho.ELM version 2.0 contains 1,703
  phosphorylation site instances for 556 phosphorylated proteins. (Diella 2004)
- Phospho.ELM is a manually curated database of eukaryotic phosphorylation sites.
  The resource includes data collected from published literature as well as high-throughput
  data sets. The current release of the Phospho.ELM data set (version 7.0, July 2007)
  contains 4078 phospho-protein sequences covering 12,025 phospho-serine, 2,362 phospho-threonine
  and 2,083 phospho-tyrosine sites with a total of 16,470 sites. For each phospho-site
  we report if the phosphorylation evidence has been identified by small-scale analysis
  (low throughput; LTP) that typically focus on one or a few proteins at a time or
  by large-scale experiments (high throughput; HTP), which mainly apply MS techniques.
  It is noteworthy that in our data set there is a small overlap between instances
  identified by LTP and HTP experiments. (Diella 2007)
- The current release of the Phospho.ELM data set (version 9.0) contains more than
  42,500 non-redundant instances of phosphorylated residues in more than 11,000 different
  protein sequences (3370 tyrosine, 31 754 serine and 7449 threonine residues). For
  each phosphosite we report whether the phosphorylation evidence has been identified
  by small-scale analyses (low-throughput, LTP) and/or by large-scale experiments
  (high-throughput, HTP), which mainly apply MS techniques. The majority of the protein
  instances from Phospho. ELM are vertebrate (mostly Homo sapiens (62%) and Mus musculus
  (16%)) though 22% are from other species, mainly Drosophila melanogaster (13%) and
  Caenorhabditis elegans (7%). In total, more than 300 different kinases have been
  annotated and a document providing additional information about all kinases annotated
  in Phospho.ELM can be found at http://phospho.elm.eu.org/kinases.html. (Dinkel 2010)
