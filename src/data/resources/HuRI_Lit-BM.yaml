- High-quality non-systematic Literature dataset. In 2013, we extracted interaction
  data from BIND, BioGRID, DIP, HPRD, MINT, IntAct, and PDB to generate a high-quality
  binary literature dataset comprising ~11,000 protein-protein interactions that are
  binary and supported by at least two traceable pieces of evidence (publications
  and/or methods) (Rolland et al Cell 2014). Although this dataset does not result
  from a systematic investigation of the interactome search space and should thus
  be used with caution for any network topology analyses, it represents valuable interactions
  for targeted studies and is freely available to the research community through the
  search engine or via download.
